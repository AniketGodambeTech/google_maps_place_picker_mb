# Contributing

Thank you for considering to contribute. There are a few things keep in mind, so that your PR can be approved with easy:

- Consider opening an issue describing the changes you want to make
- Branch off `dev`, not `master`
- When changing any dependencies, please use Flutter stable version (the `pubspec.lock` should not be altered by other versions)
- Rebase with `dev` before attempting a PR
- PR against `dev`, not `master`, and tag the relevant issue, if there is one

Happy coding!
